RFM Analysis for E-commerce Data
This project conducts an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on an e-commerce dataset to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to provide insights into customer retention, sales trends, and product performance.

Project Overview
The dataset contains online transactions from a UK-based e-commerce retailer between 2010 and 2011. Using this data, RFM analysis was performed to categorize customers into different segments based on how recently, how often, and how much they purchased.
